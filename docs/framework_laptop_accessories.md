title: My Favorite Framework Accessories for 2023
---

These are some of my favorite accessories that I’ve been using with my framework laptop for the last two years.
I started with the do it yourself until 11th GEN motherboard and then upgraded to the 12th GEN.

And then 3-D printed a couple different cases to house the 11th GEN motherboard and I'm using it in my homelab.
