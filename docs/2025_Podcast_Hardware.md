## Video capture card

### Camera Clean HDMI Check

* If you go with another camera, you will need to check for clean HDMI out.
* A great sight to check for that is https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link/camera-check.

### Without pass-through HDMI

Currently Testing this card out because it treats the HDMI as UVC which acts as a camera.
So Video Calling, Camera, Mac & Linux all work out of the box.
