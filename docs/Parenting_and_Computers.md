## When did you introduce your kids to a tablet?

### Age 4-6 Tablet Training

We got them the amazon fire tablets and they have the best parental settings

They where limited to 1 hour screen time.

Later on when the PC's came in, the tablet's became a Car Travel tool.



## When did you introduce your kids to a PC?

For Context, I have 4 Boys at the time of writting 2024-04-02,
They are 12, 10, 7 and 3 months old.

### Age 6-8 Start with Raspberry Pi
From the age of 6-8 I started having them work with thier own Raspberry Pi's.

Talking with my wife, She thinks our 2ed born was more ready to do the PC starting at age 6, verses our first born wasn't ready till age 8.


#### Projects and working time
Each weekend we would set the timer for 2 hours.
Set up Thier Desk with a monitor each, and the other parts neeeded.

They had to learn how to compleatly assemble them (From bare bones),
Hook up each of the cables.
* HDMI
* USB Keyboard
* USB Mouse
* Speakers


This also gave a LOT of opertunity to **learn troubleshoot skills** to WHY something wasn't working.

We went through the Raspberry Pi Books that came with the kits to first to learn how to flash an OS onto them.



### Early Programming

Then We started on scratch (Drag and Drop) programming to create thier own games.

After setting up the Raspberry Pi's we started to create games.

We started with

After the workbook we did these flashcards
(ScratchJr Coding Cards: Creative Coding Activities)[https://amzn.to/3xe3sQQ]
(The Official Scratch Coding Cards (Scratch 3.0): Creative Coding Activities for Kids)[https://amzn.to/3xliV1A]


After about a year Later we tried some Minecraft programming with python,
But they pi's didn't have the software for arm and the book was for x86.

About this time is when we had them build thier own PC's.

## Age 7-9 Starter PC Build 

We went with a simple build, 

Intel i3 10th Gen


## Consuming or Creating Content

We have the boys record videos, then edit and post them online (after I've helped review them).

We aren't just consuming others content, but also giving them an opportunity to create and learn some new skills.

Teaches them that contribution is equally important as consumption, If not more really.

I took them through a youtube creation seminar, so they start to learn other skills too.
