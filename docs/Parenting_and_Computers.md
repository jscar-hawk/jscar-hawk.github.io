## When did you introduce your kids to a PC?

For Context, I have 4 Boys at the time of writting 2024-04-02,
They are 12, 10, 7 and 3 months old.

### Age 6-8 Start with Raspberry Pi
From the age of 6-8 I started having them work with thier own Raspberry Pi's.

#### Projects and working time
Each weekend we would set the timer for 2 hours.
Set up Thier Desk with a monitor each, and the other parts neeeded.

They had to learn how to compleatly assemble them (From bare bones),
Hook up each of the cables.
* HDMI
* USB Keyboard
* USB Mouse
* Speakers


This also gave a LOT of opertunity to **learn troubleshoot skills** to WHY something wasn't working.

We went through the Raspberry Pi Books that came with the kits to first to learn how to flash an OS onto them.

After setting up the Raspberry Pi's we started to create games.


### Early Programming

Then We started on scratch (Drag and Drop) programming to create thier own games.


After about a year Later we tried some Minecraft programming with python,
But they pi's didn't have the software for arm and the book was for x86.

About this time is when we had them build thier own PC's.

## Age 7-9 Starter PC Build 

We went with a simple build, 

Intel i3 10th Gen
