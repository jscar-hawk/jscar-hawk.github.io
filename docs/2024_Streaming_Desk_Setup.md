My Linux Audio and Video Setup

With a large amount the workforce going remote, I wanted to share what I am using.

To help fund the projects I work on, the links are Amazon Affiliate links. This will let amazon know I sent you, and give me a small kickback if you buy that product. None of these are sponsorship, they do not get to see what I am saying about the products before I post online. Theses are products that I use and recommend!

If you are looking to use a DSLR Camera,
you will have to make sure it supports Clean HDMI.
Here is a great site to check for that [elgato clean hdmi check](https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link/camera-check)

### Without pass-through HDMI

Currently Testing this card out because it treats the HDMI as UVC which acts as a camera.
So Video Calling, Camera, Mac & Linux all work out of the box.

[Mirabox USB3.0 4K HDMI Video Capture Card](https://amzn.to/42TZ9Gd)
Cheap Option

[EVGA XR1 lite Capture Card](https://amzn.to/3IjocZY)
Favorite Option

[Elgato Cam Link 4K](https://amzn.to/42YPZbw)
A great option if you want to get into the elgato eco-system
