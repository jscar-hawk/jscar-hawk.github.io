## Video capture card

Video capture card I use types that work with linux.

If you are looking to use a DSLR Camera,
you will have to make sure it supports Clean HDMI.
Here is a great site to check for that [elgato clean hdmi check](https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link/camera-check)

### Without pass-through HDMI

Currently Testing this card out because it treats the HDMI as UVC which acts as a camera.
So Video Calling, Camera, Mac & Linux all work out of the box.
