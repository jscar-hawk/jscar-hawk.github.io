My Linux Audio and Video Setup

With a large amount the workforce going remote, I wanted to share what I am using.

To help fund the projects I work on, the links are Amazon Affiliate links. This will let amazon know I sent you, and give me a small kickback if you buy that product. None of these are sponsorship, they do not get to see what I am saying about the products before I post online. Theses are products that I use and recommend!

If you are looking to use a DSLR Camera,
you will have to make sure it supports Clean HDMI.
Here is a great site to check for that https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link/camera-check[elgato clean hdmi check]

### Without pass-through HDMI

Currently Testing this card out because it treats the HDMI as UVC which acts as a camera.
So Video Calling, Camera, Mac & Linux all work out of the box.

There are difference power supplies, but DO NOT USE THEM IF THEY ARE NOT 12V at 2A!
You will cook your light, and once the magic smoke is out, it can't be put back in.
